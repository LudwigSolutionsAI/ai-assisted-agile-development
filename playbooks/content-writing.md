# Content Writing with AI

## Background

Content writing is an important part of software development. It is used to document the codebase, write commit messages, and communicate with other developers via things like blog posts. It is essential to write clear, concise, and informative content to ensure that the codebase is well-documented and easy to understand.

I sometimes struggle getting all of the thoughts out of my head and a little help from an AI assistant to help figure out a directrion can be very useful.

## Recommendations
- Use an AI assistant, like GitHub Copilot, in your code editor as you write.

    Now that Copilot is available in Visual Studio Code for free, it is easy to get started. I find that sometimes it finishes my sentences in just the way I would have written them and other times it provides a completly different perspective that I find useful and educational.

- Learn how to accept the next word (command + -> on a Mac) or the whole completion (Tab on a Mac) to speed up your writing process.

    Not having to type out every word can be a real time saver. I find that I can get my thoughts down faster and then go back and edit them to make them more clear and concise.
