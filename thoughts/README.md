# Thoughts

A place for me to outline my current thinking on how AI integrates into my software development process. These thoughts are intended to be living documents that will be updated as my thinking evolves.

They may or may not turn into articles posted to [Substack](https://aiassistedagiledevelopment.substack.com/)
or as playbooks in the [playbooks](../playbooks/README.md) directory.
