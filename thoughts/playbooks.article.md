# Playbooks in AI-assisted Agile Software Development

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-assisted software development, developers are facing a familiar challenge: how to consistently deliver quality code while incorporating new tools and methodologies. With AI tools changing weekly and best practices still emerging, it's easy to get lost in the sea of change. This is where [AI-assisted agile development playbooks](https://github.com/mikegehard/ai-assisted-agile-development/tree/main/playbooks) come in.

## Understanding Software Development Playbooks

Think of a playbook like a chef's recipe book. Just as a chef doesn't reinvent cooking methods for each meal, developers shouldn't reinvent their approach for each common task. A playbook is a structured collection of proven principles, guidelines, and practices for handling specific scenarios or tasks.

Historically, playbooks emerged from the need to standardize complex operations in software development. Companies like Google and Amazon have long used playbooks for everything from incident response to code reviews. Now, with AI tools becoming integral to development workflows, playbooks are more crucial than ever.

The best playbooks are:
- Concise yet comprehensive
- Easy to follow
- Regularly updated
- Backed by real-world experience

## Introducing AI-assisted Agile Playbooks

I've been doing agile software development for 20+ years at companies like Pivotal Labs/Pivotal and LivingSocial.
I've seen firsthand how powerful agile software development practices can be for delivering high-quality software quickly.

My current journey is to integrate AI tools into my agile software development flow to increase the velocity at which I can add end-user value while keeping the quality high. Along the way, I've started to document my flow in the form of playbooks. The goal of these playbooks is to document and refine the practices that I'm using in my own work.

You can find these playbooks in [the AI-assisted agile development GitHub repository](https://github.com/mikegehard/ai-assisted-agile-development/tree/main/playbooks), where I'll be regularly updating existing playbooks and adding new ones based on my real-world experiences.

My goal is to help developers navigate the complex world of AI-assisted agile development by providing clear, actionable guidance on how to leverage AI tools effectively. Whether you're new to AI or a seasoned pro, these playbooks will help you stay on track and deliver high-quality code with confidence.

## Moving Forward

Playbooks are becoming essential tools for navigating the intersection of AI and agile development. They help teams reduce the amount of time spent "reinventing the wheel" and ensure that real-world practices are consistently applied across projects.
