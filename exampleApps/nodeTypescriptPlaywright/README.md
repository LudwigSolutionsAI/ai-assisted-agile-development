# Node.js TypeScript Playwright Example

This project demonstrates a simple Hello World application using Express.js with TypeScript.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Running the Application

- To start the development server with hot reloading, run `npm run dev`.
- To build the TypeScript files, run `npm run build`. This will create a `dist` folder with the compiled JavaScript.
- To start the production server after building, run `npm start`.

The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing
