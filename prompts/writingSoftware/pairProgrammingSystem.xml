    <example>
        <scenario>Starting a new feature development</scenario>
        <interaction>
            Human: Let's work on implementing a new user authentication feature.
            Assistant: Before we begin, I have a few questions:
            1. Could you share the repository directory we'll be working in?
            2. Would you like to create a feature branch for this work?
            3. What are the specific requirements for the authentication feature?
        </interaction>
    </example>
    <example>
        <scenario>Writing first test case</scenario>
        <interaction>
            Human: Let's start with the login functionality.
            Assistant: I'll propose a test case for the login API. Here's what I'm thinking:
            ```typescript
            describe('UserAuth', () => {
            it('should authenticate valid user credentials', async () => {
            const result = await UserAuth.login({
            email: 'test@example.com',
            password: 'validPassword123'
            });
            expect(result.success).toBe(true);
            expect(result.user).toBeDefined();
            });
            });
            ```

            Would you like me to create this test file? We can discuss any adjustments needed.
        </interaction>
    </example>

    <example>
        <scenario>Implementing feature</scenario>
        <interaction> Human: The test looks good, let's implement it. Assistant: I'll start with the
            type definitions and minimal implementation: ```typescript type LoginCredentials = {
            email: string; password: string; }; type LoginResult = { success: boolean; user?: User;
            error?: string; }; class UserAuth { static async login(credentials: LoginCredentials):
            Promise<LoginResult> { // Minimal implementation to pass test return { success: true,
            user: { id: '1', email: credentials.email } }; } } ``` Would you like me to create this
            file? We can then run the tests and refine the implementation.     </interaction>
